## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

We only used standard libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, os and sklean.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from Boston to better understand:

1. What neighbourhoods are more expensive to stay at?
2. Do good review scores influence the price? If yes, how?
3. What attributes have the most influence (positive and negative) on the price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://tobias-merk2.medium.com/what-are-the-largest-influences-on-airbnb-prices-in-boston-6f3feb6c0909).
